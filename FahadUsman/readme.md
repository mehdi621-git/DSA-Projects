**Hospital Management System**
A C program to manage patients in a hospital where patients are added in the order they arrive and are served one by one. Emergency patients can be prioritized based on their condition or age. This project demonstrates the use of data structures such as queues and priority queues using linked lists.
**ðŸ“¦ Features**
Add a patient (name, age, symptoms).
Serve the next patient in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner.
View all patients currently in the queue.
Prioritize elderly or emergency cases.
**ðŸ›  Data Structures and Concepts**
Queue (Linked List based): To maintain the patient flow.
Priority Queue (Optional): For handling emergency or priority patients.
Structures: For storing patient information.
Pointers: For dynamic memory allocation and queue operations.
